## Installing

### Composer

Installing Certain can be done through a variety of methods, although Composer is
recommended.

Until Certain reaches a stable API with version 1.0 it is recommended that you
review changes before even Minor updates, although bug fixes will always be
backwards compatible.

```
"require": {
  "tedivm/certain": "0.1.*"
}
```

### Github

Releases of Certain are available on [Github](https://github.com/tedivm/Certain/releases).
