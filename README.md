Certain is a library designed for checking SSL Certificates. It takes
certificates either directly or from the server hosting them and checks the
entire chain for errors.

It is currently grossly unstable and being developed actively- feel free to
contribute!

## Installing

### Composer

Installing Certain can be done through a variety of methods, although Composer is
recommended.

Until Certain reaches a stable API with version 1.0 it is recommended that you
review changes before even Minor updates, although bug fixes will always be
backwards compatible.

```
"require": {
  "tedivm/certain": "0.1.*"
}
```

### Github

Releases of Certain are available on [Github](https://github.com/tedivm/Certain/releases).
